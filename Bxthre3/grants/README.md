## ESTCP Reactivation (March 24, 2026)

ESTCP was **suspended March 23** due to accuracy concerns. It has been **reactivated March 24** after revalidation by Pulse (System Health Monitor).

### What Was Fixed

1. **Accuracy Claims**: MAPE/R² reframed from "verified data" to "engineering projections" — no field data exists yet (deployment May 2026)
2. **Digital Workforce Added**: Section 4 + supporting evidence doc quantify AgentOS 25+ agents, 1:4+ human-to-network ratio
3. **Document Status**: All claims now accurately represent current state of development

### ESTCP Package Location

Primary: `Bxthre3/projects/the-irrig8-project/docs/management/ESTCP_SUBMISSION_FINAL.md` (v2.0)

Supporting:
- `ESTCP_AGENTOS_WORKFORCE.md` — Digital workforce evidence
- `ESTCP_FIELD_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL_NITRATE.md` — Gap #1
- `ESTCP_CYBERSECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT.md` — Gap #3
- `ESTCP_PHASE2_BACKUP_SLIDE.md` — Phase 2 roadmap
- `ESTCP_SPECTROSCOPY_DECISION.md` — Engineering decision log
