**ROOT CAUSE:** org.ts writes to /data/agentos/org/chart.json — that path does not exist. All 24 employees in org.ts are never loaded. The org.ts module is non-functional.

**RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**
1. Fix data path in core/hierarchy/org.ts (change /data/agentos/org → /home/.z/agentos/org)
2. Run stub-finder.ts again post-fix to confirm resolution
3. Decide: canonical roster = org.ts (24) or live API (14) — pick ONE
