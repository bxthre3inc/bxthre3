## 2026-03-24 | Inaugural R&D Scan — Technology Landscape Report

**Status:** Active — First Run

### R&D Mandate
- Monitor AI/AG technology landscape
- Evaluate new AI models and platforms
- Run proof-of-concept projects
- Prototype new agent capabilities
- Assess competitive agent systems
- Maintain technology radar
- Coordinate with Engineering on integration
- Publish monthly R&D insight reports

### Current Tech Radar (2026-03-24)

#### 🔴 ADOPT — Move Fast
| Technology | Signal | Implication for Bxthre3 |
|---|---|---|
| **GPT-5.4 (Thinking/Pro)** | OpenAI's first true "agentic" model, built for orchestrating sub-agents | Zo/AgentOS should evaluate ASAP — if GPT-5.4 Thinking handles multi-agent handoff better than current stack, Architecture should consider it for Zoe's core reasoning loop |
| **OpenClaw** | Open-source agent platform, 250K+ GitHub stars, likened to Linux by Jensen Huang | ⚠️ WATCH CLOSELY — could commoditize agent frameworks. If it gains enterprise traction, AgentOS positioning must differentiate on vertical depth (ag/farming) not horizontal tooling |
| **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** | Becoming the de-facto standard for connecting AI agents to external tools | Priority integration for AgentOS — should wire MCP into Zoe's tool layer before it becomes table-stakes |

#### 🟡 EVALUATE — Proof of Concept
| Technology | Signal | PoC Direction |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | Still the coding benchmark leader per Google's Android dev ranking | PoC: Have Zoe prototype a complex multi-file refactor using Claude Opus 4.6 via Zo API — compare output quality to current model |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash Audio** | Tight with GPT-4o Audio at top of Voice Showdown (Scale AI) | If Irrig8 ever adds voice control or field-worker audio interface, this is the model to benchmark |
| **Nvidia NemoClaw** | Nvidia's secure fork of OpenClaw for RTX/DGX | When enterprise customers ask about on-prem AI agent deployment, this is the answer. Monitor for AgentOS enterprise tier |
| **Voice AI (Scale AI Voice Showdown)** | New Eval paradigm — blind user comparison across 60+ languages | Could inform how we benchmark Zoe's voice interactions in the future |

#### 🟢 HOLD — Monitor
| Technology | Signal | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic Claude (US Gov context)** | State Dept dropped Claude in favor of GPT-4.1 — political, not technical | Don't over-index on this. Claude still leads on many benchmarks. The government decision reflects policy, not model quality |
| **Chinese OpenClaw forks (Zhipu AI)** | Rapid adoption in China, one-click install | Watch for APAC market implications if VPC or Irrig8 expand internationally |
| **Promptfoo (acquired by OpenAI)** | Security + testing tooling for AI agents now inside OpenAI | Implies agent security testing will become mandatory. Sentinel/Vault should evaluate Promptfoo methodology for AgentOS red-teaming |

---

### Immediate Priorities

1. **MCP Integration** — Bits needs to know if we're wiring Model Context Protocol into Zoe's tool layer. This is the most important architectural decision in the near term.
2. **OpenClaw Threat Assessment** — If OpenClaw commoditizes agent frameworks, Bxthre3's moat is vertical depth (Irrig8 farming domain) + deterministic data (sensor ground-truth). Make sure that's articulated.
3. **GPT-5.4 Evaluation** — Run a Zoe vs GPT-5.4 Thinking benchmark on a complex agent orchestration task. If it wins, Architecture needs a migration plan.

### Competitive Watch

| Competitor | What They're Doing | Bxthre3 Response |
|---|---|---|
| **CrewAI** | Multi-agent orchestration, growing enterprise adoption | AgentOS already has more agents + deterministic UX. Differentiate on farm vertical |
| **AutoGPT** | Consumer-facing agentic AI, broad awareness | Our moat: real sensor data + deterministic farming logic. AutoGPT has no domain depth |
| **LangChain** | Developer framework, wide adoption | Zo/AgentOS should offer higher abstraction — agents, not APIs |
| **OpenClaw** | Open-source agent OS, viral growth | See above — vertical depth is the answer |

---

### Coordination
- Bits (CTO): Primary stakeholder for architecture decisions
- Roadmap (Product): For product integration decisions
- Engineering: For MCP PoC execution
- Sentinel/Vault: For agent security evaluation (Promptfoo)
