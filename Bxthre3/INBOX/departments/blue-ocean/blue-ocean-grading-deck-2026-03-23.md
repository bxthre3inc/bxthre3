## HOW TO GRADE

| Grade | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Build now — pass | Blueprint starts build immediately |
| **B** | Promising — needs your spec review | Blueprint drafts spec, waits for your OK |
| **C** | Deferred — not right target right now | Moves to Deferred pile — revisit when conditions change |
| **D** | Dependency hit — not worth stalling over right now | Flag the dependency clearly. Move immediately to next opportunity. Never sit idle. |

**Triage rule:** If an opportunity needs you mid-build and you're unavailable → grade it C (Deferred), keep hunting. Don't starve.

## OPPORTUNITIES

### O-001: Arid-Land Ethanol CI Scoring Module
**One-liner:** Standalone API module that generates GREET-compliant carbon intensity scores for ethanol feedstock grown in water-stressed regions (Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas).

**Gates:** G1(Pass) | G2(Fail) | G3(Fail) | G4(Fail)  
**Scanner score:** 3.1/5.0  
**AI Score:** 2.75/5.0  
**AI Grade:** D  
**Human Grade:** ___  

**AI Scoring Breakdown:**
| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Uniqueness | 30% | 4 | 1.20 |
| Automation level | 25% | 2 | 0.50 |
| Time to cash | 20% | 2 | 0.40 |
| Competitive defensibility | 15% | 3 | 0.45 |
| Bxthre3 fit | 10% | 2 | 0.20 |
| **Total** | | | **2.75** |

**AI Reasoning:** True blue ocean (G1 pass) but automation fails hard. Patent filing requires attorney (human). Ethanol plant LOIs require BD (human). Irrig8 data moat not live yet. 40% human involvement — fails mandate. Grade D.

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| G1: Blue Ocean | ✅ Pass | True blue ocean — BASF/Verity focus on Corn Belt, none targeting arid-land irrigation energy |
| G2: Automation | ❌ Fail | Requires patent filing (legal), LOIs with ethanol plants (relationship-dependent), ongoing technical support |
| G3: Speed | ❌ Fail | Even with fast build, pilot LOIs + legal = 3-6 months minimum |
| G4: Bxthre3 Fit | ❌ Fail | Irrig8 data moat not ready (no SFDs deployed), needs ethanol plant relationships |

**Why it surfaced:** Regulatory Radar + Competitive Silence  
**Competitors:** BASF Circalo (Corn Belt only), Verity/CIBO (general), incite.ag (general ethanol CI)  
**Revenue model:** License to ethanol plants (POET, Green Plains, Valero) — $50-200K/plant/year  
**AgentOS build estimate:** 6-8 weeks for MVP  
**Human involvement:** ~40% (legal, BD, plant relationships)  
**Sources:** BASF Circalo launch Feb 2026; EPA/GREET methodology documentation; Ethanol RFA farm-level CI report May 2024

**Scanner verdict:** PASS — fails automation gate. Requires patent attorney + ethanol plant LOIs + ongoing relationship management. Not 100% automatable.  
**Your call:** Override? If you grade B or above, AgentOS will build it with human-assisted BD layer.

### O-002: Starting5 Self-Serve SaaS
**One-liner:** AI co-founder matching platform — $49/mo subscription, automated onboarding, Stripe-payments. Users select from 5 archetypes and get matched with AI co-founder personas.

**Gates:** G1(Fail) | G2(Pass) | G3(Pass) | G4(Pass)  
**Scanner score:** 3.4/5.0  
**AI Score:** 3.35/5.0  
**AI Grade:** C  
**Human Grade:** ___  

**AI Scoring Breakdown:**
| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Uniqueness | 30% | 2 | 0.60 |
| Automation level | 25% | 5 | 1.25 |
| Time to cash | 20% | 4 | 0.80 |
| Competitive defensibility | 15% | 2 | 0.30 |
| Bxthre3 fit | 10% | 4 | 0.40 |
| **Total** | | | **3.35** |

**AI Reasoning:** Passes automation and speed gates beautifully. But G1 fails — crowded red ocean with MicroMVP, Co-Founder AI, and others already in market. 5-archetype model is trivially copyable. Defensibility is weak. Grade C — park and watch. Cash potential is real if you want fast revenue but not blue ocean.

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| G1: Blue Ocean | ❌ Fail | Crowded market — MicroMVP, Co-Founder AI, MicroCorp, tons of vertical AI agents |
| G2: Automation | ✅ Pass | 100% self-serve, Stripe, no human needed |
| G3: Speed | ✅ Pass | Landing page + Stripe = 2-3 weeks to first revenue |
| G4: Bxthre3 Fit | ✅ Pass | AgentOS can build and run it |

**Why it surfaced:** Forum Mining (HN, Reddit complaints about expensive human co-founders)  
**Competitors:** MicroMVP, Co-Founder AI, MicroCorp, MicroAcquire, StartupSesh — all active  
**Revenue model:** $49/mo subscription via Stripe, self-serve checkout  
**AgentOS build estimate:** 2-3 weeks  
**Human involvement:** ~5% (approve copy + pricing)  
**Sources:** Y Combinator 2025 cohort data; AngelList AI co-founder listings

**Scanner verdict:** PASS — not blue ocean. Red ocean micro-SaaS. But generates cash fast.  
**Your call:** Override? If you grade B or above, AgentOS builds it as a cash-generating side product.

### O-003: Irrig8 Water Court Evidence Automation
**One-liner:** AgentOS-powered automated evidence package generator for Colorado Water Court — compiles satellite imagery, sensor data, neighboring system data, and historical patterns into court-ready documentation for irrigation water rights.

**Gates:** G1(Pass) | G2(Pass) | G3(Fail) | G4(Pass)  
**Scanner score:** 3.7/5.0  
**AI Score:** 4.05/5.0  
**AI Grade:** B  
**Human Grade:** ___  

**AI Scoring Breakdown:**
| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Uniqueness | 30% | 5 | 1.50 |
| Automation level | 25% | 4 | 1.00 |
| Time to cash | 20% | 3 | 0.60 |
| Competitive defensibility | 15% | 3 | 0.45 |
| Bxthre3 fit | 10% | 5 | 0.50 |
| **Total** | | | **4.05** |

**AI Reasoning:** Only opportunity that passes 3 of 4 gates. True blue ocean — no automated Water Court evidence product exists. Direct fit with Irrig8 SLV data pipeline. Automation passes. Human involvement ~15% (you review before filing) — below 10% threshold but close. Time-to-cash is the risk: 4-6 week build against June 2026 hearing = tight. Grade B — needs your decision on whether to accelerate for the hearing or park.

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| G1: Blue Ocean | ✅ Pass | No product exists that automates Water Court evidence for irrigation rights |
| G2: Automation | ✅ Pass | 100% AgentOS-buildable, automated report generation |
| G3: Speed | ❌ Fail | Water Court hearing June 2026 — timeline is 3 months, tight |
| G4: Bxthre3 Fit | ✅ Pass | Direct fit with Irrig8 data pipeline and Water Court prep |

**Why it surfaced:** Regulatory Radar (Colorado Water Court rules) + Competitive Silence (no incumbents doing this)  
**Competitors:** None identified — manual law firm process dominant  
**Revenue model:** Direct service to Irrig8 pilot farmers + potential referral to water rights attorneys  
**AgentOS build estimate:** 4-6 weeks  
**Human involvement:** ~15% (you reviewing final evidence package before filing)  
**Sources:** Colorado Water Court Division 3 (San Luis Valley) procedures; existing Water Court evidence requirements

**Scanner verdict:** PASS — true blue ocean, passes automation. But timeline is tight for June 2026 hearing.  
**Your call:** If you grade B+, AgentOS builds it for the June hearing. If you grade C, it parks until after Water Court.
